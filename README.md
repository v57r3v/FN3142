Question   1
(a) What is the“efficient markets hypothesis”?   [30 marks]
(b) Suppose we are at time t, and we are interested in the efficiency of   the market of a given
stock. Let Ωt(w)   denote the weak-form. efficient markets information set at time   t, Ωt(ss)   denote the   semi strong-form. efficient markets information set at time t, and Ωt(s)   denote the strong-form.	
efficient markets information set at time t. To which information set, if any, do the following   variables belong? Explain. [70 marks]
1.    The   stock   price   today.
2.   The   3-month   US   Treasury   bill   rate   today.
3.    The   inflation   rate   last   year.
4.    Next   year’s   expenditures just   approved   by   the   company’s   board   of   directors    (and   not   announced   yet).
5.    The   value   today   of   a   put   option   on   the   stock   that   has   a   six-month   maturity.
6.    The   value   of the   stock   at   time   t + 3.
7.    The   number   of   shares   AQR   Capital   Management   (a   hedge   fund)   purchased   today   of   the   stock.
Question   2(a)          Show    that    a    stationary    GARCH(1,1)    model    can    be    re-written    as    a    function    of   the   unconditional      variance    and    the    deviations    of    the    lagged    conditional      variance    and    lagged   squared   residual   from   the   unconditional   variance.   [20 marks]
Hint:    a   GARCH   (1,1)   model   can   be   written   in   the form.	
σt(2)+1 = W +   βσt(2)   +   Qεt(2)   ;
where W, Q,   and   β   are   constants,   and   εt   is zero-mean white noise with conditional variance σt(2)   .(b)   Derive   the   two-step   ahead   predicted   variance   for   a   GARCH(1,1),   denoted   by   σt(2)+2.t   and   deﬁned      as      Et   [εt(2)+2],      as      a      function      of   the      parameters      of   the      model      and   the      one-step      ahead   forecast.   [40 marks](c)   Derive   the   three-step   ahead   predicted   variance   for   a   GARCH(1,1)   and   con-jecture   the   general expression for   a   h-step ahead forecast.   Give   an   example   of a   ﬁnancial   application   that   may require using ah-step ahead forecast.   [40 marks]
Question   3
(a)   Deﬁne   the   concept   of “trade   duration”   in   ﬁnancial   markets   and   explain   brieflywhy   this
concept is econo代 写FN3142 Quantitative Finance
代做程序编程语言mically useful.   What features do trade durations typically exhibit   and   how   can we model these features?    [25 marks]
(b)   Describe   the   Engle   and   Russell   (1998)   autoregressive   conditional   duration (ACD)   model. [25 marks]
(c)   Compare   the   conditions   for   covariance   stationarity,   identiﬁcation   and   positiv-ity   of   the   duration   series   for   the   ACD(1,1) to   those   for   the   GARCH(1,1). [25 marks]
(d)    Illustrate the relationship between the log-likelihood of the ACD(1,1) model   and the   estimation of a GARCH(1,1) model using the normal likelihood function. [25 marks]


Question   4
Consider   two   stochastic   processes:    (i)   Xt   ,    about   which   we   do   not   know   anything   for   now,   and   (ii)   vt   ,   which   is   a   zero-mean   white   noise   with

Moreover,   we   know   that   v   and   X   are   uncorrelated   at   all   leads   and   lags,   that   is,   E[Xtvt-j   ] =   0
for all   j integers. Let an observed series Zt bedeﬁned as
Zt      = Xt   + vt.
(a)   What   does   covariance   stationarity   mean?   [15 marks]
(b)      Prove that the process Zt   is covariance stationary if and only if   Xt   is covariance   stationary.   [20 marks]
Now   assume   that   Xt    is   an   MA(1)   process:
Xt      = ut   + δut-1   ,
where   ut    is   zero-mean   white   noise   with   
   (c)   Calculate the autocovariances of the process Xt    and show   that   it   is   covariance stationary.
[20 marks]
(d)   Calculate   the   autocovariances   of   Zt    and   show   that   they   are   zero   beyond   one lag.
[20 marks]
(e)   Is   it   possible to   represent the   process   Zt    as   an   MA(1)   process?    In   particular, assume   that   we   write
Zt      = εt   + θεt-1   ,                                                                                                                                                                                          (1)
where εt   isa zero-mean white noise with variance σε(2)   .   What would be the required restrictions
on   θ   and   σε(2)   so   that   Ztis   an   MA(1) process?   [25 marks]
Hint:    based    on   the    assumption      (1), derive the autocovariances of Z   as a   function    of θ    and   σε(2),   and   compare   them   to   your   results   in   (d)   .
