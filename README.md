PRELIMINARY EXAM 2019
Question 1 
Consider a forecast  of a variable, Yt. You   have   100   observations   of  and Yt and
you   run the following   regression:

The following   results are obtained:

a)         What,   if anything, can we   infer from this   output? 60 marks 
b)       The   picture   in   the   Figure   1   is   based   on   daily   returns   on   General   Electric   over   the   period   1990-1999. What does this picture    reveal about the conditional variance of General   Electric   returns? What volatility   model do you suggest for   this   asset? 40 marks

x-axis represents return on day t; y-axis represents the squared return on day t+1.
Question 2 
a)       Define the   Efficient   Market   Hypothesis   (EMH) and   distinguish   between   its   weak-   form, semi-strong and   strong form. 15 marks 
b)       Discuss Fisher Black's interpretation   of the   EMH and explain why   it   maybe difficult to test empirically. 10 marks 
c)       What is   the role of   forecasting models    and   search   technologies   in   refining   the   information   set?   Define   market   efficiency   according   to   Granger   and Timmerman   (2003) 25 marks 
d)       After   extensive   empirical    research,   someone   finds   evidence   of   predictability   in   stock   returns that   cannot   be   possibly explained   as   compensation for   risk   bearing.   Is   it   necessarily a violation   of the   EMH? 25 marks 
e)       Briefly state the random walk model for asset   prices and discuss whether the   EMH 代 写FN3142 QUANTITAIVE FINANCE PRELIMINARY EXAM 2019Statistics

Question 3 
Consider   using a   historical simulation   method   (HS) and a   GARCH   method for   forecasting   volatility. After   building the so called   hit variables:

the following   regressions are   run, with standard errors   in   parenthesis corresponding   to   the   parameter estimates:
Hitt(H)s      =   0.0814   +    μt                                                         (0.0132)
Hitt(GA)RCH      =   0.0207   +    μt                            (0.0123)
a)       Describe how the   above   regression   output   can   be   used to test   the   accuracy   of the   VaR   forecasts   from   these   two   models   and   decide   whether   the   VaR   forecasts   are   accurate or   not? 40 marks 
b)          Describe how you can determine the best convex combination of the    two   forecasts   in the sense of   mean squared   error   minimisation. 60 marks 
Question 4 
a)       Show   that   a   stationary   GARCH(1,1)   model   can   be   re-written   as   a   function   of   the   unconditional variance   and the   deviations   of the   lagged   conditional variance   and   lagged squared   residual from the   unconditional variance 20 marks 
b)       Derive   the   two-step   ahead   predicted   variance   for   a   GARCH(1,1)   as   a   function   of   the   parameters of the   model and the one-step forecast. 40 marks 
c)         Derive   the   three-step   ahead   predicted   variance   for   a   GARCH(1,1)   and   infer   the   general   expression   for   a   h-step   ahead   forecast.   Give   an   example   of   a   financial   application that   may   require   using a   h-step ahead forecast? 40 marks
